## About Teckmon

#### Engineer

Teckmon graduated with a degree in Industrial Engineering (I.E.) from Georgia Tech in 2013. She joined Cornell University Investment Office and worked as a Quantitative Investment analyst for 2 years in Ithaca, NY prior moving back to Atlanta, GA. Currently, She is working in the business intelligence and data analytics fields. Her favorite programming languages are SQL and Python, and her favorite software are Tableau, RedGate, Google Analytics, and Git.

#### Certified Yoga Instructor

Teckmon has been practicing yoga for eight years and received her 200-hour Yoga Certification from YogaWorks in Atlanta under Becky Nickerson in Spring 2018.  Vinyasa flow is foundational to Teckmon’s yoga practice as she combines awareness of breath and movement while focusing on proper body alignment. She believes yoga is a wellness process that nourishes the body, mind, and soul. 

Teckmon strives to make yoga accessible to people of all ages and skill levels through her creative sequences. She incorporates the bus-stop method to break down challenging poses into 3 bus stops and allow students to make decisions where to go based on how they feel of the day. 

Breathing and relaxation did not come at ease for Teckmon. Her breath was once choppy and short, and her muscles are always tight and tense. She enjoys working with students to guide them with some breathing exercises and building strength and confidence.

#### Weightlifter

Teckmon loves weightlifting. She had her first coaching lesson at Coffee Gym in 2014, and she was hooked! In the beginning, there are some up and down while learning the technique and dialing in with her nutrition. Now, she trains consistently to stay balanced mentally and physically. You can find her weightlifting journey @teckmonster. 

#### Everyday Life

She finds creativity through engaging and volunteering in the local community, she sharpens her writing and coding skills through sharing content in Pick Up Strength. (she built this website with Jekyll and deploy blog posts via Terminal command line. ;) ) If you haven't heard from her, she is probably backpacking in the wilderness where there is no cellular access. Her latest trip was backpacking in the Skoki Loop in Banff, Alberta.

## Pick Up Strength

Teckmon will call herself a weird hummingbird. She loves to explore every flowers and tree, her favorite is Tea Olive and a field of wildflowers. In Pick Up Strength, this place will fill with creativity, non-judgment, positivity, and a healthy dose of encouragement and curiosity from everything she gathers.

As I am sitting here and trying to craft the best about page for Pick Up Strength to grab your attention, I don't have one. I don't have one yet. I am still figuring out, and I don't want to put a limit in it of what it will be becoming. However, I do know that I want to create a place for my audiences and myself to grow strong, to explore, to be curious, and to learn from a different perspective and be open-minded to try new things. I guess it is part of the process.

	"Curiosity and discipline create passion. If you wait for motivation, you will never get anything done. Be curious. Be receptive. ❤ Pick Up Strength"

I want to help people who have similar barriers and obstacles. Obstacles like in learning a new language, moving to a new place, getting through college, strength training, nutrition, cross-cultural relationship, stress management, get a stronger mind and body, etc. I hope that you will learn something new from me and to share with others. 

The one thing I am asking for my audiences is being receptive, curious to explore beyond your horizon, and take action. There is no limit unless you put a boundary at the end. 

Curiosity sparks questions. Curiosity creates action. Curiosity is inclusive. Curiosity is our non-judgment friend that always invite us and give us clues. I found my strength and confidence through curiosity about weightlifting. 


I want to share my stories from my perspective through my special lenses. The conflict interest of being a dual identity, the curious mind I always carry with me as a little girl, the strength and confidence I found through some boring and tedious paint strokes and lifting sets and reps, the nerdiness and creativity I develop when I start to code are all part of the features define the unique me.

I grew up with my grandparents in the countryside a couple of hours away from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. I am always curious about things and enjoy learning how things work from start to finish. I moved to the United States with my family at the end of 9th grade and it was a drastic change in my life and I had to redefine myself, my purpose of life in a new country. I was lost and struggled with life.

Coming to this new country without knowing the primary spoken language very well, I had trouble expressing my feeling, the curious mind that I had gotten fuzzy and lost. I had the fear of asking questions and thought that no one could understand me. I felt lost in translation.

Up until after graduating from college working on my first big girl job, I found my curiosity and resilience again. When looking back at the first English paper I wrote, when I first learned how to lift weights compared to today, I see improvement and changes. I believe that it does not matter what it is, if I can be consistent with learning and growing, I will be the person I wanted to become and continuously grow stronger into the best version of myself. 

I felt that there is a piece of me that I am always fear in pursuing and haunted me for life is to be seen, to be known, to be me due to my fear of expressing myself. In this place, I now stop all my hesitation, anxiety, and doubt and share my journey with you. Please join me to unleash your strength. 



I started weightlifting 
If I want to describe myself and for my audiences to get to know me better, it will be a hybrid of a hummingbird and a butterfly. 


It has the strength of butterfly, it evolves overtime. 

And then something happened...

The flight of the nature born of a hummingbird, moving from tree to tree, from flower to flower, from field to field, trying this, trying that, create complex life for themselve, and cross poninate the world.
