H E L L O -

I am tm, the creator of Pick Up Strength and currently reside in the United States. 

I graduated with a degree in Engineering and currently working in the business intelligence and data analytics fields. Outside of my day job, I enjoyed coding with creativity, pick up strength with a barbell, and backpacking in the wilderness, and last but not least, sharing more content in Pick Up Strength.

As I am sitting here and trying to craft the best about page for Pick Up Strength to grab your interests, I don't have one. I don't have one yet. I am still figuring out, and I don't want to put a limit in it of what it will be becoming. However, I do know that I want to create a place for my audiences and myself to grow strong, to explore, to be curious, and to learn from a different perspective and be open-minded to try new things. I guess it is part of the process.

I want to share my stories from my perspective through my special lenses - the conflict interest of being a dual identity, the curious mind I always carry with me as a little girl, the lessons of some boring and tedious paint strokes and strength training I learn, the nerdiness and creativity I develop when I start to code, and more.

In Pick Up Strength, this place will fill with creativity, non-judgment, positivity, and a healthy dose of encouragement and curiosity. I want to help people who have similar barriers and obstacles. Obstacles like in learning a new language, moving to a new place, getting through college, strength training, nutrition, stress management, get a stronger mind and body, etc. I hope that you will learn something new from me and to share with others. 

The one thing I am asking for my audiences is being receptive and curious to explore beyond your horizon. Curiosity sparks questions. Curiosity creates action. There is no limit unless you put a boundary at the end.


Be a humble hummingbird,

❤ tm

I grew up with my grandparents in the countryside a couple of hours away from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. I am always curious about things and enjoy learning how things work from start to finish. I moved to the United States with my family at the end of 9th grade and it was a drastic change in my life and I had to redefine myself, my purpose of life in a new country. I was lost and struggled with life.

Coming to this new country without knowing the primary spoken language very well, I had trouble expressing my feeling, the curious mind that I had gotten fuzzy and lost. I had the fear of asking questions and thought that no one could understand me. I felt lost in translation.

Up until after graduating from college working on my first big girl job, I found my curiosity and resilience again. When looking back at the first English paper I wrote, when I first learned how to lift weights compared to today, I see improvement and changes. I believe that it does not matter what it is, if I can be consistent with learning and growing, I will be the person I wanted to become and continuously grow stronger into the best version of myself. 

I felt that there is a piece of me that I am always fear in pursuing and haunted me for life is to be seen, to be known, to be me due to my fear of expressing myself. In this place, I now stop all my hesitation, anxiety, and doubt and share my journey with you. Please join me to unleash your strength. 



I started weightlifting 
If I want to describe myself and for my audiences to get to know me better, it will be a hybrid of a hummingbird and a butterfly. 


It has the strength of butterfly, it evolves overtime. 

And then something happened...

The flight of the nature born of a hummingbird, moving from tree to tree, from flower to flower, from field to field, trying this, trying that, create complex life for themselve, and cross poninate the world.
