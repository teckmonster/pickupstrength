H E L L O -

I am tm, the creator of Pick Up Strength and currently reside in the United States. 

I graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in Industrial Engineering in 2013 and currently working in the business and data analytics fields. I love to code, weightlift, and backpack in the wilderness. My ongoing goals are to share more content in Pick Up Strength.

I grew up with my grandparents in the countryside a couple of hours away from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. I am always curious about things and enjoy learning how things work from start to finish. I immigrated to the United States with my family at the age of 15. It was a drastic change in my life and I had to redefine myself, my purpose of life in a new country. I was lost and struggled with life.

Coming to this new country without knowing the primary spoken language very well, I had trouble expressing my feeling, the curious mind that I had, had no place to be. I had the problem of asking questions and feared that no one could understand me. I felt lost in translation for many years.

Up until after graduating from college working on my first big girl job, I found my curiosity and resilience again. When looking back at the first English paper I wrote, when I first learned how to lift weights compared to today, I see improvement and changes. I believe that it does not matter what it is, if I can be consistent with learning and growing, I will be the person I wanted to become and continuously grow stronger into the best version of myself. 

In Pick Up Strength, I wanted to create a safe place for my audiences and myself or maybe people who are now going through the similar struggle I had in my early age. I want you guys to get inspired and feel safe and to grow stronger mentally and physically and don’t be afraid of failures. We can learn and support each other throughout the journey. 

> Strength is contagious! ❤ Pick Up Strength

Pick Up Strength is an outlet to express myself, my perspective through different lenses, and to share my knowledge with my audiences. This place will fill with creativity, non-judgment, positivity, and a dose of encouragement. I want to help people who have similar barriers and obstacles. Obstacles like in learning a new language, moving to a new place, getting through college, stress management, get a stronger mind and body, etc. I hope that you will learn something from me and to share with others. 

I felt that there is a piece of me that I am always fear in pursuing and haunted me for life is to be seen, to be known, to be me due to my fear of expressing myself. In this place, I now stop all my hesitation, anxiety, and doubt and share my journey with you. Please join me to unleash your strength.  


❤ tm
