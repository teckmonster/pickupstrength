description: The Complete 4-Week Training Program For Beginner
---

I put together a 4-week training program. Hopefully, you will find this resourceful and have some guideline when getting into strength training. 

You can use it and share it with anyone who might find helpful! 

#### T I P S

* Pick your three training days and make sure you have at least one day in between for rest day. (e.g., Mon, Thur, Sat or Tue, Thur, Sun).
* I love the app called STRONG to track my exercise. It is free to download.
* Write down the weight you use for each set and rep for week 1 and depend on how you feel on week 1 and beginning of week 2, either add 0 or 5 lbs to the subsequent week. 
* Typically, the standard barbell is 45 lbs or 35 lbs for female. You might need to start with a lower weight with either dumbbell or kettlebells. It is okay to use assisted gears to help you get to the next level of strength.
* Be consistent with the training cycle and even you don’t feel like going to the gym.
* You might start to feel soreness if you have never been doing strength training prior. Don’t let the pain stop you.
* You will see improvement and see the result.
