Since college is starting and coming around, I thought it would be helpful to talk about some of the college advice I would give to myself when I was a student.

To give a little background about myself, I graduated from Georgia Tech in Industrial Engineering degree. I had many struggles and did not start at the same point as other freshmen. I went to community college to learn English. I failed my ESOL grammar class and had to retake it. I want to let you know that no matter what happened, it is temporary. I hope the following tips will enlight your new semester ahead! Good luck. :) 

Leave a comment down below! I would like to know what major you are in and what year you are in college and also check out the video where I go more in depth the details on my tips.

#### Tip #1: Define yourself. 

There are many clubs and student organization to join in college. A college is a place for the experiment to define yourself. Explore what you like and don’t like but don’t force yourself to try to fit into a community that wasn’t you. If nothing sparks your interests, you create your own and be an inventor! I wish I have started a Malaysian student associate and be the president to raise the awareness of Southeast Asian culture.   

#### Tip #2: Office hours. 

The curriculums at my school are extremely hard for me, and I struggled to solve many homework problems. Based on my experience at Georgia Tech undergraduate and also living in graduate fellow housing at Cornell, there is much help such as [1 to 1 tutor][tutor], office hours, group study session. If you get stuck, get help!  

#### Tip #3: Balance Lifestyle and stress management. 

College can be stressful when you are trying to meet the deadline and study for an exam. Practice self-care and have physical activities on your agenda. These are some of the things I like to do to balance my life right now.

* Pottery.
* Weightlifting or strength training. 
* Journaling.
* Take doggies for a walk.
* Take a break and go to concert.

#### Tip #4: Living at home vs. living on campus.

There are pros and cons to both livings. I highly encourage to live on campus for the first couple of years. That way you get to experience fully being a college student! There are many events, and student group sessions happened after hours. It will be difficult if you are living and have to commute.

#### Tip #5: Communicate with your parent or those who support you. 

Send a smiley face that you survive for your first week! They would love to hear from you now and then. 

#### Tip #6: Try new thing.

* Take classes that are outside of your major. 
* Join a mentorship program. 
* Go to a career fair. 
* Go to a party and bar hopping.
* Slide down the slope during winter time! (if you live in cold weather).
* Fall in love.

#### Tip #7: Go outside and explore.

Explore the city or town beyond your college campus. You can now rent a bike or take a ride to explore the one-mile radius. Go to football game or take acting classes!

#### Tip #8: Don’t aim for perfection. 

Making A’s or have 4.0 or 4.4 GPA are not the only way to measure success after college. Let yourself know that it is okay to fail a class or two. Learning from failure and move on to the next goals!

#### Tip #9: Extra pocket money.

There are many positions available on campus that you can earn extra pocket money and be independent. Below are some of the examples: 

* Teaching assistant
* Personal trainer
* Research assistant 
* Resident assistant
 
#### Tip #10: Don't do drugs. 
 
I have nothing to say! Just don’t.
