I am a podcast junkie and always scouting for new one. My latest new find is Y Combinator; it is pretty technical + entrepreneur! 

I started listening to podcasts when I was commuting to work. My commute was long, and typical spent about 3 hours in the car and eventually developed a habit and collected a list of my favorite podcasts.

If you have ios, Overcast is my favorite app to download episodes, and it is free. When I used to have iPhone, this app allowed me to slow down the tape since my English listening skills weren't as sharp as today! Android people I got you covered as well. Castbox is what I am using now! 

If you are new to podcasts and stumbled into here, I highly recommended Planet Money. Planet Money has over 800 episodes, and there isn't a topic they haven't covered, and you will find a good list of them that grab your interests. I am learning new things every time I listen to this podcast. My recent episode is #858: Venezuela’s Fugitive Money Traders. I couldn't believe chocolate, milk, bread, etc. are worth more than their paper currency! You have to listen to this and won't regret it.

Here are 2018 favorite podcasts:

#### How I Built This 

    I love every episode of How I Built This by Guy Raz podcasts. This podcast is filled with inspired moments of successful companies build from nothing to something. If you are curious about innovators, entrepreneurs, and idealists and all the stories how they built from nothing to something, you will enjoy this podcast.

#### Planet Money

    “The economy explained. Imagine you could call up a friend and say, "Meet me at the bar and tell me what's going on with the economy." Now imagine that's a fun evening.”
