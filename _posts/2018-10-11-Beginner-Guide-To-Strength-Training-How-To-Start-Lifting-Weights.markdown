I have been lifting weights for 3 years now. In today blog, I want to share my 12 tips for beginner's guide to strength training. 

#### Your starting point

Everyone begins at different levels. When I first started, I have no athlete background, and I did not train in competitive sports since middle school volleyball. You have to start somewhere. I gain some strength from yoga then slowly move to basic barbell training. 

#### Consistency

Set aside a block of time where you dedicate for lifting weights. Morning or later afternoon, whichever work for your schedule.

* I like to use the STRONG app to keep me stay on track. 
* Have your workout cloth and pre-workout meal ready the night before. 

#### Use assisted 

Banded squat, banded pull-ups. When I first get my first pull-ups, I practice many reps using resistance bands. I also wear a hip band above my knees to prevent knee collapse for form improvement. My fiance got himself kettlebells to practice in his small apartment.

#### Hire a coach

Hire a personal trainer or coach with at least one of the following credentials. These are the one I trusted because they will teach you to do exercises with proper forms and technique and educate injury prevention. This way you get your basic cover.

* Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS)
* USA Weightlifting (USAW Level 1, 2)
* CPPS Coach

#### Barbell vs. kettlebell vs. dumbbell

A standard barbell weighs about 20 kg (~ 45 lbs). I like to start out with an empty barbell to warm-up and do the following reps and sets. Depending on your goals and training cycle, you can adjust it to your goals.

For those who train at home and are not use to barbell squats, you can start with a couple body squat for warm-up and pick up the 12kg (~ 25 lbs) or 16kg kettlebells for goblet squat. 

#### Starting Strength - learn these 3 basic barbell techniques

There are many exercises out there you can do to improve your strength and wellness. When starting anything new, do not introduce too much variety. Sometimes, it can be overwhelmed. I recommend getting the basic barbell techniques (squat, bench or overhead press, and deadlift) down. There are tons of tutorials videos to learn how to perform the movement. 

I have a [printable version][program] of training program so you can get an idea what it is like. I do highly recommend to get a local coach, so you get your basic cover.

#### Learn some basic anatomy 

Having the underlying anatomy, I understand where the muscles are and allow me to focus and emphasize the muscles while performing the movement. 

#### Breathing techniques

Breathing technique is crucial in weight training. We practice breathing to protect our spine. Think of your spine, you need to make it fill with air when moving the weights. 

I have written an article about diaphragmatic breathing. If it does not click, Kyle from [T Nation][tnation] simplistic explanation is that you can image of one rubber band around your belly and one rubber band around your chest. Both rubber bands should expand as you take a breath in. 

A short clip from Mark Rippetoe 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECTeHDD_RrM

> It has to do with an instantaneous tightening right at the second when the greater force is played. We are playing force for the whole rep and not for just the duration of a blow. 
We are going to take a big breath, we are going to hold it, we are going squeeze down and up. We are going to use that to protect our spine. ~ Mark Rippetoe

[Valsalva Maneuver][valsalva] : 
 
 My translation is in parenthesis below.

* Inhale Before or During the Negative. (Unrack, inhale, when ready sip a little more air, brace, squat down)
* Exhale Against Closed Glottis at Start of the Positive. (brace, still holding my breath)
* Exhale After Sticking Point & Complete the Positive. (brace, squat up until you passed the sticking point, then exhale)
* Repeat

The next time when you are doing planks or sit on an imaginary chair behind a wall, don't hold for a specific time period like 45s, instead count your breaths. This way you get to practice with the breathing techniques.

#### What is #1 lifting exercise you should start

I cannot stress enough the benefits of a weighted squat. A squat is a compound movement that targets the full body specifically to the thighs, hips, quadriceps, hamstring, gluteus maximus, and more. You get to train with a lot of muscles with just one exercise. 

#### Just do it.

You just need to do it. There might be a time you are sore, tired, no time, or it is raining out, or it is hot out... The environment factors do not get a vote on your training day. You will improve with practice and time. 

#### Recovery & nutrition

Proper recovery is essential. Make sure you get enough sleep. Take an Epsom salt bath. Foam roll.

#### Nutrition

Make sure you get enough protein throughout the day. 1.5g per lb. Have carbs before and after your training session. Link to my nutrition.
