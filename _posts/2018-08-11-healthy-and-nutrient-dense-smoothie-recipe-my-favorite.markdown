I have to share my favorite smoothie recipe with you because it has improved my nutrition and protein intake drastically. This smoothie has been my morning fuel for a year now, and it is a well balanced and nutrient dense recipe with macronutrients - protein, healthy fat, and fiber! Depending on your nutrition goals, you can use this recipe and tailor to your needs. The goal is to make sure your smoothie has these macronutrients.

If you want to read my smoothie journey, then keep reading, or you can jump to the ingredients section.

Two years ago, when I first started to bring smoothie into my diet, I did not know what to put in my smoothie. I found a couple of recipes on the web, and there are ways too many selections and none of those caught my eyes. It is usually banana strawberries smoothie, mocha chocolate smoothie, etc. I did not know what I was doing, and my smoothie ingredients were something like a big handful of strawberries, cucumber, water as base, ice, squeeze of lemon juice. I would make it at home and bring it to the office. 

At the time, I thought it is going to be great! I will get a boost of lots of vitamin C and antioxidant. Healthy Smoothie. Younger face right? 

I did something wrong with my nutrition because I always felt fatigue and my fiance told me I wasn't getting enough protein in my diet considering I tried to lift weights. I found out that the smoothie that I had had zero protein. I mean zero. It is all carbs. :(

I am not a big fan of peanut butter banana with two scoops of whey protein powder and blend it with ice. It is the go two smoothie my fiance loved. I didn't like whey protein powder in my smoothie, in fact, it gave me terrible stomach pain, bloating, gas, cramps for two months then I later found out that I have a problem digesting whey protein. His mom suggested some of the plant-based powder. Garden of Life, Sun Warrior, and Vega, I tried it all. It is either they are too sweet and has a weird texture.
