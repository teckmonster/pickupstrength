* Pick your three training days and make sure you have at least one day in between for rest day. (e.g., Mon, Thur, Sat or Tue, Thur, Sun).
* I love the app called STRONG to track my exercise. It is free to download.
* Write down the weight you use for each set and rep for week 1 and depend on how you feel on week 1 and beginning of week 2, either add 0 or 5 lbs to the subsequent week. 
* Typically, the standard barbell is 45 lbs or 35 lbs for female. You might need to start with a lower weight with either dumbbell or kettlebells. It is okay to use assisted gears to help you get to the next level of strength.
* Be consistent with the training cycle and even you don’t feel like going to the gym.
* You might start to feel soreness if you have never been doing strength training prior. Don’t let the pain stop you.
* You will see improvement and see the result.
