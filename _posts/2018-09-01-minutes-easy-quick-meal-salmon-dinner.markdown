This quick and easy salmon dinner took me the same amount of time as frying three sunny sides up eggs. If you are interested in how I pull together this 5-minute meal, then keep on reading! 

Making salmon for dinner was like a nightmare to me before not counting the time to scrub the pan. :( I am not patient enough to bake anything when I am starving after coming back from work or gym.

I tried cast-iron, wok, other "non-stick" skillet pans and most of them do not work and anything will eventually stick to the pan itself.

While the search continues, I come across an article by [Organic Authority][organic-authority] that mentioned non-toxic cookware brands that will keep chemicals out of your food. Like, I tried so hard to eat healthily and organic required produces but I never thought of it is just as essential to cook them in green and non-toxic cookware. 

Finally, I found the secret weapon in searing salmon. It is the stone earth frying pan by Ozeri. It is APEO & PFOA-Free pan and has a non-stick coating! 

I have been using this pan many times for frying eggs and salmon, and they are my favorite. 

Recipe and ingredients are below. Please let me know how it goes!

#### Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon of Ghee

    Ghee is pure butterfat and has a high smoke point and many health benefits. I have switched my frying oil with Ghee since I no longer use other frying oil like canola or vegetable oil. Olive oil is not ideal for frying due to its low smoke point.  

* 1 salmon fillet, patted dry, and salt & paper

    I like to use frozen wild salmon, and I will take the pieces I want to cook to thaw out the day before.

* 1 [Kumato][kumato], slice and salt & paper

    Kumato is my favorite tomato. They are sweeter than regular tomatoes and very juicy. It is rich in potassium, magnesium, and vitamins A and C. Last week, I was able to find them in the Asian market for $0.99 per pack; usually, there are $3.99 per pack at Whole Foods. 

* 1 handful of spinach

    After salmon is flipped, I make some room in the pan and add the spinach. Salt & pepper with some olive oil. Cover with lid to create a steam effect which speeds up the cooking process.

* 1 serving of pickled vegetable
 
    For a healthy gut, I love to include a small serving of pickled vegetables in my meal. :)
