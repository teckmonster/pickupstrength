I have to share my favorite smoothie recipe with you because it has improved my nutrition and protein intake drastically. This smoothie has been my morning fuel for a year now, and it is a well balanced and nutrient dense recipe with macronutrients - protein, healthy fat, and fiber! Depending on your nutrition goals, you can use this recipe and tailor to your needs. The goal is to make sure your smoothie has these macronutrients.

If you want to read my smoothie journey, then keep reading, or you can jump to the ingredients section.

Two years ago, when I first started to bring smoothie into my diet, I did not know what to put in my smoothie. I found a couple of recipes on the web, and there are ways too many selections and none of those caught my eyes. It is usually banana strawberries smoothie, mocha chocolate smoothie, etc. I did not know what I was doing, and my smoothie ingredients were something like a big handful of strawberries, cucumber, water as base, ice, squeeze of lemon juice. I would make it at home and bring it to the office. 

At the time, I thought it is going to be great! I will get a boost of lots of vitamin C and antioxidant. Healthy Smoothie. Younger face right? 

Getting the right amount of nutrients to support my lifting session has been a struggle. I wasn't getting enough protein that my body needed. I always felt fatigued, and my training suffered. My fiance mentioned that I wasn't getting enough protein in my diet. The smoothie that I like to make had zero protein. I mean zero. It is all carbs. :( I have to listen and make some changes. 

I am not a big fan of peanut butter and banana with two scoops of whey protein powder and blend it with ice. It is the go two smoothie my fiance loved. I didn't like whey protein powder in my smoothie, in fact, it gave me terrible stomach pain, bloating, gas, cramps for two months then I later found out that I have a problem digesting whey protein. His mom suggested some of the plant-based powder she is using. I tried Garden of Life, Sun Warrior, and Vega and they are either way too sweet and has a weird texture.

I start to read nutrition books and continue doing my research in protein powder that will work for me, and the rest is history that I will blog about next time.

#### Ingredients

* 1.5 to 2 cups unsweetened vanilla almond milk
* 1 serving unflavored protein powder (2 scoops)
* 1 tablespoon hemp seeds
* 1 tablespoon chia seeds
* 1 tablespoon MCT oil
* 1 tablespoons almond butter or 1/4 avocado
* a small handful frozen wild Boreal blueberries (optional)
* a small handful frozen chopped spinach
* a pint of Celtic sea salt

#### Macro Breakdown

Coming soon.

One serving with x Protein, x Carbs, x Fat.

#### Instructions

Place all the ingredients in a high-speed blender and blend until desired consistency. I like to put liquid in the blender cup first!

I finally found my favorite protein powder. It is the Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides. It is pasture-raised, grass-fed, non-GMO, and Kosher. Their collagen powder is soluble in cold and hot liquids, and you can put them in coffee or mixed into a smoothie.

These are some of the benefits of collagen peptides listed on their site:

* promote youthful skin, healthier hair, and stronger nails
* helps keeps bones healthy and supports joint health
* whole 30 Approved, Gluten Free, Dairy Free

I do see that my nails are getting healthier and my hair is growing so long that I need a trim soon.

Until then, see you next time!
