When performing an exercise, I like to ask myself the following questions.

#### Questions:

1. Why do this exercise?
	
	There are many exercise out there you can do to improve your strength and wellness. It is good to know a handful and do it well.

2. Which muscles does this exercise targeting? 

	Understanding this, it allows me to focus and emphasize the muscles while perform the movement. 

3. How to do it safely?

	Coming from weightlifting training, I like to make sure doing exercises with proper forms and technique. If you are not sure about how to do certain exercise, don't be afraid to ask the gym owner or personal trainer for demostration. There are many great resources in YouTube as well.

4. If I have to pick one exercise and what will it be?
	
	I cannot stress enough the benefits of weighted squat. Squat is a compound movement that target the full body specifically to the thighs, hips, quadriceps, hamstring, gluteus maximus, and more. You get to train with a lot of muscles with just one exercise. 

	A standard barbell weighs about 20 kg (~ 45 lbs). I like to start out with an empty barbell to warm-up and do the following reps and sets. Depending on your goals and training cycle, you can adjust it to your goals.

	For those who train at home and are not use to barbell squats, you can start with a couple body squat for warm-up and pick up the 12kg (~ 25 lbs) or 16kg kettlebells for goblet squat. 

	Couple things I like to keep in mind when performing squats and I will go over in the next blog.

### The 7 Best Glutes Exercises To Grow You Glute 

Here are my favorite exercies to get stronger and improve my lower body physique.

###### Weighted Squat

* 3 sets x 5 reps @ 80% of my 1 rep max 
* Examples of the weights I use: warm-up [45lbs, 95lbs, 135lbs], training sets/reps [160 lbs, 160 lbs, 160 lbs].

###### Lateral Banded Walk

* 3 sets x 12 steps per leg
* I like to use the red band and do laternal walk for dynamic warm-up prior my squat or deadlift session. It wakes up my glute muscles and really help me use more glutes rather than mostly quads during each movement. 

###### Banded Glute Bridge

* 3 sets x 15 reps
* If I want the extra burns and glute workout toward the end of training, I use the blue band to do glute bridge. Keep in mind to hold for couple seconds at the top and squeeze your butt chins (like pincing a quarter in between).

###### Banded Hip Thrusts with Barbell

* 3 sets x 12 reps
* I like to use black band to add resistant and it is amazing muscle memory cue to keep my knee push out.

###### Single Legged RDL

* 3 sets x 12 reps per leg

###### Back Extension

* 3 sets x 10 reps

###### Bulgarian Split Squat

* 3 sets x 12 reps per leg
