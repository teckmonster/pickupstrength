Here are my favorite exercies to get stronger and improve my lower body physique.

###### Weighted Squat

* 3 sets x 5 reps @ 80% of my 1 rep max 
* Examples of the weights I use: warm-up [45lbs, 95lbs, 135lbs], training sets/reps [160 lbs, 160 lbs, 160 lbs].

###### Lateral Banded Walk

* 3 sets x 12 steps per leg
* I like to use the red band and do laternal walk for dynamic warm-up prior my squat or deadlift session. It wakes up my glute muscles and really help me use more glutes rather than mostly quads during each movement. 

###### Banded Glute Bridge

* 3 sets x 15 reps
* If I want the extra burns and glute workout toward the end of training, I use the blue band to do glute bridge. Keep in mind to hold for couple seconds at the top and squeeze your butt chins (like pincing a quarter in between).

###### Banded Hip Thrusts with Barbell

* 3 sets x 12 reps
* I like to use black band to add resistant and it is amazing muscle memory cue to keep my knee push out.

###### Single Legged RDL

* 3 sets x 12 reps per leg

###### Back Extension

* 3 sets x 10 reps

###### Bulgarian Split Squat

* 3 sets x 12 reps per leg
