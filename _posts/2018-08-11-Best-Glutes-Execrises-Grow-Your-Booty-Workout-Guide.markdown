description: best glutes exercises to grow your glute
---

I started resistance training and powerlifting in 2015 and getting into weightlifting in 2016. I absolutely love lifting weights. The first moment when I am hooked into lifting was when I learned how to jerk 35kg (~77lbs) overhead. It is kind of my kick-ass moment that you don't want to mess with a 110lbs girl! Now, my best jerk is a little over my body weight. The second moment when I am even hooked is that I notice my physique is starting to change. Like, my shoulders have more definition, and my booty got meat and bun. Excuse my weird language. That is what my fiance said. 

I want to make it accessible and less intimidate for you to start lifting! I understand it can be very discouraging to start especially with no lifting background. I have been there!

You don't really need to go to a gym or need a big machine to start resistance training. You can begin to resistance training at your home or basement with just 2 things:

1. A barbell or a kettlebell

    A standard barbell weighs about 20 kg (~ 45 lbs). I like to start out with an empty barbell to warm-up and do the reps and sets from my program. Depending on your goals and training cycle, you can adjust it to your goals.

    For those who train at home and are not use to barbell training, you can start with a couple body squat for warm-up and pick up the 12kg (~ 25 lbs) or 16kg kettlebells for goblet squat, single legged RDL, and split squat. 

2. Fabric resistance bands
    
    Resistance bands are instrumental and versatile. It provides great resistance. I use it for my deadlift and squat when I first started lifting to avoid collapsing in the knees and it is a great cue to push my knee out when lifting. The resistance and color coordination I mentioned below is based on this [resistance bands set][resistance-band]. 

Here are my favorite exercises to get stronger and improve my lower body physique.


###### Weighted Squat or Banded Squat

* 3 sets x 5 reps @ 80% of my 1 rep max or with black band

###### Lateral Banded Walk

* 3 sets x 12 steps per leg
* I like to use the red band and do lateral walk for dynamic warm-up prior my squat or deadlift session. It wakes up my glute muscles and really helps me use more glutes rather than mostly quads during each movement. 

###### Banded Glute Bridge

* 3 sets x 15 reps
* If I want the extra burns and glute workout toward the end of training, I use the blue band to do glute bridge. Keep in mind to hold for couple seconds at the top and squeeze your butt chins (like pinching a quarter in between).

###### Banded Hip Thrusts with Barbell

* 3 sets x 12 reps
* I like to use the black band to add resistant, and it is a fantastic muscle memory cue to keep my knee push out. 

###### Single Legged RDL

* 3 sets x 12 reps per leg

###### Bulgarian Split Squat

* 3 sets x 12 reps per leg

Please check back to this post as I will attach more pictures here for illustration. 

Until next time, see you then.
