MS. TIPPETT: So I think one thing — and I think you also — it took you a little while to come to this. One thing that you have started to say that is really helpful is that you've started to see the danger of this refrain that's everywhere out there in our culture to follow your passion, follow your passion. And that that also becomes a way that people feel themselves excluded because they're not sure what their artistic passion would be. Or again, if it's their passion, can they really measure the value they're creating?

And I love the language of “curiosity” you use, and I'd love for you to talk some more about that. I mean, one thing you've said is the difference between passion and curiosity as something you're following is that “curiosity is a milder, quieter, more welcoming, and more democratic entity.” [laughs]

MS. GILBERT: [laughs] Oh, I love curiosity our friend. I mean, I think curiosity is our friend that teaches us how to become ourselves. And it's a very gentle friend, and a very forgiving friend, and a very constant one. Passion is not so constant, not so gentle, not so forgiving, and sometimes not so available. And so when we live in a world that has come to fetishize passion above all, there's a great deal of pressure around that. And I think if you don't happen to have a passion that's very clear, or if you have lost your passion, or if you're in a change of life where your passions are shifting or you're not certain, and somebody says, “Well, it's easy to solve your life, just follow your passion.” [laughs] I do think that they have harmed you because it just makes people feel more excluded, and more exiled, and sometimes like a failure.


MS. GILBERT: You know? And I think that's really important because here is one of the grand misconceptions about creativity. And when people dream of quitting their boring job so that they can have a creative life, one of the risks of great disappointment is the realization that, “Oh, this is also a boring job a lot of the time.” [laughs] It's certainly tedious. I mean, it's a boring job I would rather do than any other boring job. It's the most interesting boring job I've ever had, but...

MS. TIPPETT: But every job has boring in it, right?

MS. GILBERT: Yes, yes. I mean, I have a theory that I'm just growing, and I haven't really put a roof on it, but I'll throw it out there, which is that everything that is interesting is 90 percent boring.

MS. TIPPETT: Yeah. That's right.

MS. GILBERT: And we are sort of in a culture that's addicted to the good part, right? The exciting part, the fun part, the reward. But every single thing that I think is fascinating is mostly boring. So — marriage. I mean, good Lord, can there be anything more fascinating than joining two souls together in union and to spend a life entwined? Ninety percent boring.


MS. GILBERT: Right. Yeah, well, trust is a big piece of it, isn't it? And I think motion is a big piece of it. I've learned to give myself all the credit in the world simply for being in motion. Did you do something today toward this thing? Then you're good. [laughs] Was it great? No. Was it fun? No. But did you do it? Did you keep the ball rolling? Did you keep another step on that path going? Then you're fine. That's it.
