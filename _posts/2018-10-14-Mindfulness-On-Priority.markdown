---

Teaching and volunteering for my second yoga class, I feel like I have the luxury of people time. It is a rewarding experience when students show up, trust you as a leader, give their health & wellness as a priority, and give one hour of their time to spend it with you. I did not quite get it the first time when I volunteered to teach.


	"Priority: the fact or condition of being regarded or treated as more important.”


Everyone has 24 hours per day. How we use it depends on everyone priority. Some prioritize in their family, some prioritize in their career, some prioritize in their appearance, some prioritize in their knowledge. All priority could fall to the bottom when we neglect our health and well being. Opportunities might not always be knocking on your doors when nothing makes it to the "list".

Students, teachers, kids, farmers, mother/father-to-be, speakers, we all have priority. Some priority might intersect, most often they do not. Interestingly, we do not understand each other priority which causes conflict in many situations.

I want to invite my readers to set an intention for today on priority. Mindfulness on setting your priority at the same time understand other priority. You may or may not understand the reasons behind each other priority, but we all have the seeds to be mindful and respectful of the differences.

##### Couple tips for mindfulness on understanding other priority.

	We do not have to understand the reasons behind why they do. Instead, we need to realize that the things that they do make them fulfilled and happy.

	We do not have to argue why priorities are set in a certain way, join if it works for you, leave if it does not work for you.

##### Couple tips for mindfulness on setting your priority.

	Instead of saying “I don’t have the time,” trying saying “It’s not my priority” and see how you feel and how other feels. If it feels right for you, you own your priority. If it does not feel right for you, maybe consider being flexible and make accommodation for others.

	Instead of saying “I don’t have money,” trying saying “It’s not my priority” and see how you feel and how other feels. If it makes your life or others life easier, you own your priority. If it does not make your life or others life easier, consider allocating your wealth somewhere it needs.


So much so we often make excuses to justify the SOUND. Why?

There is no need to make excuses and there are countless important things to do in life. Life is short. We may or may not get to do all of it but if it sparks your interests, free your soul to do it and enjoy every bit of it.



Until next time,
