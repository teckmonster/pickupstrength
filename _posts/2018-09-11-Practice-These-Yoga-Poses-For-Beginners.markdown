Coming soon.

#### Cat & Cow

Cat & Cow poses are typically done in a pair to warm up the spine from your neck region to your tailbone. Often time we are sitting all day and shrugging our shoulders and cause much tension in those areas. I love these poses because it is accessible to achieve. Practice cat & caw to open up your chest and increase the fluidity of your body.

Inhale to cow pose,
Exhale as you return to cat pose.

#### High Plank to Chaturanga

Chaturanga Dandasana is the foundational pose of yoga sequences and many times it is a transitional pose and is neglected to perform correctly. 

Couple mistakes to avoid is that don't let your shoulders collapse below elbows and do not stick your butt up. If you have not developed arm balance strength, it is okay to drop your knees and activate your core strength. 

#### Child Pose

There is the time our body is requesting a pause, and we need to listen to our body. It is okay to surrender and come to a child pose to reconnect your breathing, your mind. 

Focus on diaphragmatic breathing.

#### Puppy Pose Shoulder Stretch Variation

#### Updog or Cobra

#### Down Dog

#### Twisted High Lunges

#### Wide-Legged Forward Fold
