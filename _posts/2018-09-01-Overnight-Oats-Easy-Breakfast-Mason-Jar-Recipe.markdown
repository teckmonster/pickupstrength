#### Ingredients

* ½ cup of oats

* ½ teaspoon of raw shelled hemp seed (or raw almond butter)
* Slices of fresh bananas
* Handful of frozen wild berries or strawberries
* 2 tablespoons of dragon fruit

Chia seeds are high in Omega-3 fatty acid and have an excellent source of fiber.

Add hemp seeds or nut butter to give a little nutty flavor and creamy texture.
